# Basic-SQL
## Background & Objectives

The goal of this challenge is to query the database **from our Python code**.

## Data
We will work with the `movies.sqlite` database available at this URL:
`https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/sql_databases/movies.sqlite`

## Tool

For that we will use a library that comes with Python, called **sqlite3**, a Jupyter Notebook and DBeaver to connect to the `data/movies.sqlite` database and use a SQL Editor to build and test the SQL queries.
